# Ourchitecture

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ourchitecture/site-ionic-ng.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ourchitecture/site-ionic-ng)

## Setup

This project was created with the [Ionic CLI](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/cli/start/) and [Angular](https://angular.io).

## Contributing

See our [Contributor Guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Testing

Tests have been modified to use Puppeteer and the Chromium Headless browser by default.

### End-to-End (e2e)

The version of Chromium must be kept in sync between Protractor and Puppeteer. The [Puppeteer API](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md) lists the versions of Chromeium that ship with each version of the library.

## Continuous Integration

This project utilizes [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) and [Cirrus CI](https://cirrus-ci.org/).
