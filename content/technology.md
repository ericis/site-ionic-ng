## Patterns

If you are new to Patterns, start with [Brad Appleton's patterns introduction](http://www.bradapp.com/docs/patterns-intro.html). See the definition of Patterns as described in [TOGAF Architecture Patterns](http://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/m/chap25.html).

For applied patterns, consider browsing the architecture of well-established open source projects. You may also consider exploring [StackShare](https://stackshare.io/stacks) for example technology stacks; maintaining some healthy skepticism about how representative these stacks are and how applicable they may be to the context of your own environment.
